Hi! I'm Hamed. I specialize in machine learning, with a particular focus on creating algorithms that help models to learn, adapt, and evolve over time. I did my PhD in machine learning at the University of St. Gallen in Switzerland, where my research focused on the intersection of continual learning and meta-learning. I currently work as a Machine Learning Specialist in an academic role at HFT-Stuttgart in Germany.
